Smarkets take home test

## Problem

The idea is to build a single page application with ReactJS using our API which contains a list of top events on
the page, essentially a vastly simplified version of this page:
https://smarkets.com/sport/football

Clicking on an event name, it should go to a different page to display basic information about that
event. (example: name, league, start time)
