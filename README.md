# smarkets
Smarkets take home test.

## Project description

This is a single page application built with ReactJS using Smarkets API, which contains a list of soccer top events on
the page, essentially a vastly simplified version of this page:
https://smarkets.com/sport/football.

Clicking on an event name, it goes to a different page to display basic information about that
event.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. 

### Technologies used

ReactJS, React Router, React Testing Library, ESLint, Feather Icons

## How to install and run the project

To bypass CORS mechanisms, enable https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/.

Then from the root of the directory, run:

`npm install` – installs all the dependencies.

`npm start` – runs the app in development mode.

### Other available scripts

`npm run build` – builds the app for production to the build folder.

`npm test` – runs tests in watcher mode.

`npm run eject` – removes the single build dependency from your project.

## API Reference 

Smarkets frontend API ([documentation](https://docs.smarkets.com/))

## Tests

By running `npm test` all components are being tested for correcting rendering.
